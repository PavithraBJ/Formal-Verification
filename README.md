# Formal-Verification
The goal is to verify that an arithmetic circuit implemented in FPGA technology satisfies the specification provided by the verilog RTL description.  Developed a parser using Python which converts the boolean equations obtained from FPGA netlist (Altera Quartus) to arithmetic equations (input format for PetBoss tool)
